Marine ecologists assess coral bleaching during heat stress events. Prior surveys indicate 35% of coral colonies typically bleach during moderate temperature increases. During a recent warming event, you notice that 42 of 150 monitored colonies showed bleaching.

Using your new data of coral bleaching,

1. (4 points) Create two models using MCMC methods to produce an updated estimate of the bleaching probability using both an uninformed and informed prior. Provide plots of your prior and posterior distributions.
2. (1 point each) Generate 10,000 samples from your posterior distribution of bleaching probability to answer the following questions. 
   - What is the posterior mean? (expected bleaching rate)
   - What is the posterior mode? (most likely bleaching rate)
   - What are the 96% Highest Posterior Density Intervals for p? 
   - What is the posterior standard deviation? 
   - What is the probability that the bleaching rate exceeds 35%? 
   - What is the probability that the bleaching rate is below 20%?
